Once the project is open in Android Studio, you can build and run the app on an Android device or emulator by clicking the "Run" button in the toolbar.

The app has a simple user interface that allows users to enter their weight and height in either metric or imperial units.
Once the user enters their information and clicks the "Calculate" button, the app will display their BMI and a corresponding message 
that indicates whether they are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
